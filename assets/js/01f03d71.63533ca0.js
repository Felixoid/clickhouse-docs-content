There is a replication log that lists what actions to do. Actions are: get part; merge parts; drop a partition, and so on.

For example, on insertion, the \u201cget the part\u201d action is created in the log, and every replica downloads that part. Merges are coordinated between replicas to get byte-identical results. All parts are merged in the same way on all replicas. One of the leaders initiates a new merge first and writes \u201cmerge parts\u201d actions to the log. Multiple replicas (or all) can be leaders at the same time.
